1
00:00:00,599 --> 00:00:07,4
So I'm all logged into AWS here. We're going to want to jump into the VPC section, which is down here 

2
00:00:07,5 --> 00:00:16,657
under Network, and then this old boy up here is what we want, Start VPC Wizard. 

3
00:00:16,757 --> 00:00:23,657
Now then, at the time of recording, and it's been like this for awhile actually, but we've got four options, 

4
00:00:23,757 --> 00:00:27,657
only it's pretty much two options with just a slight variation on each. 

5
00:00:27,757 --> 00:00:34,657
What am I talking about? Well, we've got VPC with a Single Subnet up here, then underneath we've got VPC 

6
00:00:34,757 --> 00:00:42,657
with Public and Private Subnets. And then the two options below down here, these are just the same, 

7
00:00:42,757 --> 00:00:47,657
but with a VPN bolted on. No matter though, don't get bogged down right now, we'll cover all things 

8
00:00:47,757 --> 00:00:53,657
in all their glorious detail as we get further into the course. Right now though we're going to rock and roll 

9
00:00:53,757 --> 00:00:59,657
with option 2. We'll have a public and a private subnet, thank you very much. 

10
00:00:59,757 --> 00:01:05,657
Oh, and a nice pretty picture here, and yeah, why not, seeing as how I'm a fan of learning by repetition 

11
00:01:05,757 --> 00:01:08,657
and the likes, let's give this a quick mention while we're here. 

12
00:01:08,757 --> 00:01:15,657
This outer square here, okay, what's that? Well, okay, it's a rectangle not a square, but you're with me, 

13
00:01:15,757 --> 00:01:21,657
this outer rectangle, this is our entire VPC, our entire virtual data center that we're building, 

14
00:01:21,757 --> 00:01:27,657
then within it we're creating two subnets, a public one, and a private one. 

15
00:01:27,757 --> 00:01:33,657
Now the major difference or the only difference, to be honest, is that a public subnet is going to have 

16
00:01:33,757 --> 00:01:39,657
direct access to the internet. We're going to be able to connect out to the wider world as well as accept 

17
00:01:39,757 --> 00:01:45,657
unsolicited incoming connections. The private subnet on the other hand isn't. 

18
00:01:45,757 --> 00:01:49,657
Well, yeah, actually that'll do for now. 

19
00:01:49,757 --> 00:01:57,657
Oh, scary screen. Well, not really. Up here at the top, okay, this is the VPC stuff, subnet specific stuff 

20
00:01:57,757 --> 00:02:02,657
is below, and we'll get to that in a second. First up, the easy stuff though, VPC name. 

21
00:02:02,757 --> 00:02:10,657
I'm going to call this one podcast. Now then, the CIDR block, okay, this is where we define the network 

22
00:02:10,757 --> 00:02:17,657
or the network addresses from which all of our subnets will take their addresses from. 

23
00:02:17,757 --> 00:02:22,657
I don't know, right, think of it as like a master network, like a pool of addresses that all of our subnets 

24
00:02:22,757 --> 00:02:30,657
will then be a slice of and I know, okay, for the network savvy who are watching, I'm sure I butchered that, 

25
00:02:30,757 --> 00:02:37,657
but suffice to say, okay, whatever we choose here at the VPC definition level, our subnets have to draw from. 

26
00:02:37,757 --> 00:02:44,657
So we can't do something like 10.0.0.0 up here and then try and pick subnet address ranges down here 

27
00:02:44,757 --> 00:02:52,657
from let's just say 192.168.whatever, yeah. Look scary red text, never a good sign. 

28
00:02:52,757 --> 00:02:58,657
An actually, okay, while I'm not an uber networking guy, I am from a strong infrastructure background. 

29
00:02:58,757 --> 00:03:02,657
And you know what? I've held some Cisco certs in the dim and distant past. 

30
00:03:02,757 --> 00:03:10,657
So for those that might not know, okay, let's wipe this onto the screen here, yeah, okay, so IPv4 addresses 

31
00:03:10,757 --> 00:03:19,657
like these are broken down into 4 octets, 4 sets of 8 bits, 8, 16, 24, and 32. 

32
00:03:19,757 --> 00:03:25,657
And then by slapping /16 onto the end here, we're basically saying the first 16 bits or the first 2 octets, 

33
00:03:25,757 --> 00:03:32,657
so the numbers before the first 2 periods, these are network address. 

34
00:03:32,757 --> 00:03:38,657
I don't know, maybe like the city name in our postal address. In this case then we'd be in the 10.0 city, 

35
00:03:38,757 --> 00:03:45,657
then the remaining 2 octets are for street and house numbers of any devices that we put onto the network. 

36
00:03:45,757 --> 00:03:53,657
So the number after the /16 here is telling us how many bits constitute the network portion of the address, 

37
00:03:53,757 --> 00:04:01,657
then we're free to play with any bits that are left over to the right of that, in this case the last 2 octets, yeah. 

38
00:04:01,757 --> 00:04:07,657
Probably a totally garbage analogy I know, but who knows, right, maybe it helps somebody. 

39
00:04:07,757 --> 00:04:13,657
I'm trying hard to remember here that not all of you are going to be from an infrastructure background like me. 

40
00:04:13,757 --> 00:04:17,757
Anyway, let's clean this mess up.
