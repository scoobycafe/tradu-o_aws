1
00:00:00,599 --> 00:00:06,103
Okay, so from our EC2 console here, let's launch a new instance. 

2
00:00:06,203 --> 00:00:14,103
And we want Community AMIs here, then search for something with NAT in it. 

3
00:00:14,203 --> 00:00:19,103
This HVM bit here, just make sure that I don't get an old style pair of virtual instance, because 

4
00:00:19,203 --> 00:00:26,103
we want the full on hardware virtual machine version, right? And then 2015 just filters it so that I only see 

5
00:00:26,203 --> 00:00:33,103
recent versions. If you're watching this in 50 years, yeah, well, anyway we'll take this one here. 

6
00:00:33,203 --> 00:00:37,103
The difference being, right, this GP2 bit here, this is telling us that this one's going to be based on 

7
00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:44,103
super flashy SSD rather than magnetic rotating _____ for it's disk. 

8
00:00:44,203 --> 00:00:51,103
Anyway, micro is good for us. We want our podcast VPC up here and importantly, right, it's got to go 

9
00:00:51,203 --> 00:00:57,103
in the public subnet. Now if you stick it in the wrong subnet here, you might as well just destroy the thing 

10
00:00:57,203 --> 00:01:05,103
and build a new one from scratch because migrating instances between subnets is just, well I was going to say hard, 

11
00:01:05,203 --> 00:01:11,103
it's not actually that it's hard, it's just hmm, it's more manual than it should be. 

12
00:01:11,203 --> 00:01:19,103
Anyway, it needs to go in the public subnet, okay. And it definitely needs a public IP. 

13
00:01:19,203 --> 00:01:28,103
Right. Yep, general purpose SSD, that's good. And let's call it podcast-NAT. 

14
00:01:28,203 --> 00:01:32,103
Okay, we might as well configure the security groups while we're here. 

15
00:01:32,203 --> 00:01:36,103
So this SSH rule, that's going to be fine for now. In the real world, yeah, you're probably going to want to 

16
00:01:36,203 --> 00:01:42,103
lock the source bit down so that it just accepts connections from IPs on your management network or 

17
00:01:42,203 --> 00:01:48,103
something like that. But the thing is, right, the thing to do here is add rules for the type of traffic you 

18
00:01:48,203 --> 00:01:58,103
want to allow out. Well, we'll add a rule here for HTTP and then we'll add another one for HTTPS. 

19
00:01:58,203 --> 00:02:05,103
I don't know why they can't be together, but what we want to do is lock the source addresses down 

20
00:02:05,203 --> 00:02:10,103
to our private subnet so that only instances in the private subnet, right, are going to be allowed, 

21
00:02:10,203 --> 00:02:30,103
so that's going to be 10.0.2.0/24 and same again here (Typing). Next we want to, huh, outbound rules, 

22
00:02:30,203 --> 00:02:39,103
am I missing it? Okay I mean it's not often that I configure security groups from here, so I don't know, 

23
00:02:39,203 --> 00:02:44,103
maybe that's all you can do from here, maybe it's an old EC2 classic relic. 

24
00:02:44,203 --> 00:02:47,103
Yeah, I'm definitely not seeing a way to add outbound rules here. 

25
00:02:47,203 --> 00:02:57,103
Okay onwards and upwards. Oh, no, actually first up, let's give it a name (Typing). 

26
00:02:57,203 --> 00:03:12,103
And same again here, right, now let's go launch it (Typing). Okay, and let's find it. 

27
00:03:12,203 --> 00:03:18,103
Now to disable those source and destination checks. Networking, there it is. 

28
00:03:18,203 --> 00:03:28,103
Yep, we're sure, thank you. And I think we should be able to see it somewhere down here, yeah, there. 

29
00:03:28,203 --> 00:03:44,103
False, so disabled. Now to update the route table for our private subnet (Typing), I think this is the one, 

30
00:03:44,203 --> 00:03:57,103
yep, podcast-priv 1 here. So let's give it a new default route (Typing). 

31
00:03:57,203 --> 00:04:06,103
And the target, nice, we want this one, the NAT instance rather than the internet gateway. 

32
00:04:06,203 --> 00:04:10,103
And I reckon we're good. That's our private subnet all set up and ready. 

33
00:04:10,203 --> 00:04:15,103
So the instances that we launch in there can get out to the internet via the NAT proxy instance 

34
00:04:15,203 --> 00:04:18,203
that we put in the public subnet. Should we go wrap the module up?
