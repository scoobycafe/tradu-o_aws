1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:05,360
So let's draw out a picture, yeah, but for clarity and so we don't get distracted, I'm just going to keep it 

2
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:12,360
simple, okay. I'll leave out some of the AWS detail that we already know, like availability zones and stuff. 

3
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:18,360
Alright, let's say then we've got a couple of subnets, 1 and 2, with a couple of instances in each. 

4
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:25,360
And the up top here, we've got our VPC's router. Now the normal flow of traffic is that traffic comes into 

5
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:31,360
the router, so could be from the internet or from another subnet or from another VPC even, the point being 

6
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:38,360
traffic comes into our router, then depending on the routes in the route table, the router sends the traffic on. 

7
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:42,360
So, if it's intended for one of our subnets it gets sent on there. 

8
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:49,360
And that's it really. So where security groups and network ACLs come into play, it's like this, as traffic 

9
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:57,360
gets routed to a subnet the network A-C-L or ACL or whatever you want to call it, associated with that subnet 

10
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:04,360
inspects the traffic and then based on the rules in the ACL, it decides whether or not to allow the traffic. 

11
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:11,360
So maybe the ACL says web traffic from the internet is allowed, but SSH traffic isn't unless it comes from 

12
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:18,360
a machine with an IP address from our management network. Well then, anytime any SSH traffic comes in 

13
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:24,360
from anywhere other than the management network it's going to get dropped, not allowed through. 

14
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:29,360
And as we can see, or at least as I'm trying to show here with the padlock, and you will see that on official 

15
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:37,360
AWS diagrams, the network ACL lives and works at the subnet level, so it gets applied to subnets 

16
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:43,360
and therefore protects any instances in those subnets. Security groups, on the other hand, which are sometimes 

17
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:50,360
seen in AWS diagrams like this, well these get associated with individual instances, a bit like 

18
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:56,360
instance firewalls, well a lot like them actually. So, you know, like the Windows firewall or IP tables 

19
00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:02,360
or maybe some third party software, yeah. The point being, they're local to the instance. 

20
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:09,360
But actually, right, a bit like public and elastic IPs, our instances don't actually know anything about them, 

21
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:16,360
so they get applied or kind of wrapped around the instance. So we manage and we configure them at the AWS level 

22
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:23,360
from the AWS console. If we were to log onto our instances and look at local firewalls and the likes, 

23
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:29,360
they know nothing about them. Anyway, as we can see, right, two layers of security. 

24
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:35,360
So any traffic that gets past the network ACL has got another hurdle to jump before it makes it to the instance, 

25
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:42,360
and that's good stuff, defense in-depth, layered security, all of that goodness. 

26
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:48,360
And that's the thing to digest I reckon, right. We've got two layers, two complimentary layers. 

27
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:56,360
I think I'm going to say this a lot, right, defense in-depth. Well that's the view from like 50,000 light years. 

28
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:59,460
Let's zoom in a bit closer next and look at security groups.
