00:00:00,599 --> 00:00:08,9
So, here we go, right, a Q&A session, though totally rigged. I mean, I've not only written the questions, 

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,9
and I totally get to edit my own answers so that I'll look great or I guess sound great. 

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,9
But seriously, I've not done this in any of my courses before, so it could be a totally rubbish idea 

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,9
and I could end up sounding ridiculous, but I don't know, I was pretty stoked with the idea when I first had it 

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,9
and in my head at least, I thought it would be great. I thought you'd really like it as viewers. 

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,9
So you know what? Here's my Twitter handle. 

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,9
If anybody does actually bother to watch this module, do me a favor, right, and let me know what you thought of it 

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,9
because seriously, I mean, it's not like a sub-story or anything, but I do put a ton of effort into these courses 

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,9
and I'd really like to know what works and what doesn't. So here it goes. 

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,9
I'm a bit nervous actually. First question, so what's the biggest or most common mistake you see people making 

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,9
with AWS VPCs? Oh, cool. Nice easy one to start off with. Thanks for that. 

12
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:11,9
Yeah, this is a bit weird. Anyway, seriously right. I reckon it's VPC CIDR blocks, so choosing the 

13
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:20,9
IP address space to use in your VPC. If you've watched the course we use the 10.0.0.0/16 network 

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,9
and I feel like I blabbered on about this quite a lot in the course. 

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,9
But network planning it's just huge and it's so easy not to bother with or to get wrong. 

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,9
Probably because it's one of the first things that you do when creating your VPC. 

17
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,9
But seriously, get those CIDR blocks wrong and you can find yourself in a deep hole with no ladder to help you out, 

18
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,9
you really, really, really want to make sure you're not using the same network addresses in your VPC 

19
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,9
that you've already got in use somewhere else on your corporate network. 

20
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,9
So for instance, if you're going to go with a 10.0 network for your VPC, make absolutely sure that it's not 

21
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,9
the network you're already using in the office or your on-prem data center or anything. 

22
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,9
And if you're at a company with a dedicated network team or multiple network teams, you're definitely 

23
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,9
going to want to talk to them about this kind of thing. Get them involved and get them on your side 

24
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,9
from the start because in IT infrastructure, right, in my experience, the network is where most of 

25
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:25,9
the complexity is. I mean, did you ever wonder why just about every outage is blamed on the network? 

26
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,9
Yeah, I know a bunch of the time we use the term network issue or network incident when it's not really 

27
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:38,9
the network, but in all of my years of infrastructure experience, more often than not it is the network. 

28
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,9
And I'm not slamming networks or network people here, right? The reason it's usually the network 

29
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,9
at the core of the problem is because networking is so freaking complex. 

30
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,9
So get in early with your network team and plan out your subnets and stuff with those guys before you start 

31
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,9
tearing into your VPC. And as well, don't let the network guys fob you off because your VPC networks 

32
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,9
are out there in the cloud and not yet considered part of your network proper. 

33
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,9
Treat your VPC networks just like any other corporate network, at least from a planning and an address space 

34
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,9
perspective, because I can almost guarantee that the day will come when you're going to want to hook your 

35
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:23,9
corporate networks up with your VPCs and we saw that actually earlier in the course using VPNs and Direct Connect. 

36
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,9
So, a bit of a long winded answer, but I reckon the biggest mistake and probably one of the easiest to make 

37
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:36,9
is getting your VPC networking wrong. So yeah, networking, get it right from the start because unpicking 

38
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:43,9
a fundamental problem like duplicate CIDR blocks, it's about as much fun as, I don't know waxing your armpit hair, 

39
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,9
not that I've ever done that, obviously. Really I haven't. But you get the message, right? 

40
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Unpicking network problems is not fun.
