1
00:00:00,599 --> 00:00:06,219
So I'm going to go with 10.1 as the network for my VPC here. 

2
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:15,219
Then down in our subnet we're going to have 10.1.0 and 10.1.1. Okay, still loads of red text. 

3
00:00:15,319 --> 00:00:22,219
So, if we stick /24 onto the end of it, what we're basically saying okay is that the network portion of the addresses 

4
00:00:22,319 --> 00:00:32,219
for our subnets is actually the first 24 bits, so 10.1.0 and 10.1.1 and then because they're both slices 

5
00:00:32,319 --> 00:00:39,219
of the bigger 10.1 network that we've got up here in our VPC, the scary red text goes away and everything 

6
00:00:39,319 --> 00:00:45,219
looks good again. Now then, I don't know how many of you have picked up on this, but despite this bit here 

7
00:00:45,319 --> 00:00:53,219
being a config for our public subnet, the fact is any network address starting with 10.anything is de facto 

8
00:00:53,319 --> 00:01:02,219
and de jure, not a public network. 10.anything addresses are like full on RFC 1918 addresses, which is technical 

9
00:01:02,319 --> 00:01:08,219
uber jargon meaning they're just not publicly routable on the internet. 

10
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:13,219
In proper layman's terms here, right, any internet router that sees packets with addresses like this 

11
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:18,219
is just going to drop those packets. Here we go. Maybe time for a quick, I don't know, probably crappy 

12
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:26,219
analogy again, right, but trying to talk to a device with a 10. address over the public internet, that's a bit like 

13
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:31,219
trying to send internal office mail via the national postal service. 

14
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:37,219
So just think, I don't know, an internal mail address to Mike in accounts on the 7th floor or Mia in facilities 

15
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:43,219
on the 5th floor, right. The national post man or post woman, they're going to take one look at that address 

16
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:48,219
and probably the lack of a stamp, yeah, and just say, what? I can't deliver that. 

17
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:55,219
And they're just going to bin it. But I'm waffling, right? If our 10. public network here isn't publicly 

18
00:01:55,319 --> 00:02:02,219
routable, so not routable on the internet, then how the chuff is it going to work as a public subnet? 

19
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:06,219
I mean public subnets are all about communicating directly with the internet, right? 

20
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:14,219
And yeah you are right, they are. But you know what? I'm going to unfold this mystery in just a second. 

21
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:20,219
For now, let's just put it down to AWS magic, okay. I mean it's not and we'll see exactly how it's done 

22
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:25,219
in all of its simplistic glory in just a second, but let's not get side tracked yet. 

23
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:31,219
I just brought it up now, okay, in case there are any networking uber lords there rolling their eyes here 

24
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:37,219
like I don't know what it is, 10 minutes into the course and saying, oh this joker hasn't got a clue, 

25
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:41,219
doesn't even know what a publically routable network address is. 

26
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:49,219
Well stick with me okay. Anyway, back to the script, right. Availability zone, oh no wait, actually 

27
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:57,219
if you're in the wrong region, now's the time to change that. VPCs, okay, are per region. 

28
00:02:57,319 --> 00:03:04,219
So an entire VPC exists inside of one region and only one region. 

29
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:09,219
I'm an island here, okay, or a EU West as it's also known, and that's cool for me. 

30
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:16,219
You can be in whatever region suits you. Anyway, back down here, we've got all of the availability zones 

31
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:22,219
that are available, availability zones available, I like that, in whatever region you happen to be working in. 

32
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:25,219
For now, I'm just going to go with 1B, just because it's in the middle. 

33
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:30,219
It doesn't really matter for now. Then on the subnet name I'm going to go pub-podcast. 

34
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:38,219
Now I definitely recommend naming your subnet and to be honest, you should name everything that you can in AWS, 

35
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:45,219
unless of course you like the kind of long cryptic names that AWS assigns resources. 

36
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:48,319
Take away point here, just name your stuff, okay.
