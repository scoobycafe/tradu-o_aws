1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:07,915
So here's the deal, right, so far we've configured this like uber network, our data center for ourselves, right, 

2
00:00:08,015 --> 00:00:14,915
inside of Amazon Web Services and a module or two back we put a couple of public facing web servers in there 

3
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:19,915
and then we stuck a load balancer in front of them, all good stuff. 

4
00:00:20,015 --> 00:00:25,915
Oh, and we've seen a few times as well how we can connect to our instances using SSH or if they're Windows, 

5
00:00:26,015 --> 00:00:33,915
yeah that would be RDP, but the thing to note, right, all of this kind of access has come into our VPC 

6
00:00:34,015 --> 00:00:40,915
through its internet gateway, so all using publically routable IPs and unless we use secure protocols 

7
00:00:41,015 --> 00:00:47,915
like SSH or HTTPS, then it's all totally unencrypted. So, we're talking over the internet, right, 

8
00:00:48,015 --> 00:00:55,915
and then wide open for anyone to look at. Now, okay, all we've done so far, right, is a bit of HTTP action 

9
00:00:56,015 --> 00:01:02,915
to a static webpage or two with like 0 sensitive content, but there's like absolutely nothing stopping us 

10
00:01:03,015 --> 00:01:08,915
from hosting, I don't know, mail servers or database servers or whatever in our VPC. 

11
00:01:09,015 --> 00:01:16,915
In fact, we probably want to do stuff like that, but of course, as soon as we do, then the kind of traffic 

12
00:01:17,015 --> 00:01:21,915
we're going to be sending is almost certainly going to be more sensitive. 

13
00:01:22,015 --> 00:01:25,915
Well, if that's the case then we want to connect to those services from outside of AWS, so probably 

14
00:01:26,015 --> 00:01:29,915
from our corporate office, yeah, well we've got a couple of options. 

15
00:01:30,015 --> 00:01:36,915
We can either secure each and every connection type, so maybe configure our client so that they only talk 

16
00:01:37,015 --> 00:01:41,915
to the mail servers over secure protocols or the same for our database servers, yeah, only allow clients 

17
00:01:42,015 --> 00:01:48,915
to talk to them via secure protocols, or we can configure a secure virtual private network, a VPN, 

18
00:01:49,015 --> 00:01:54,915
or a tunnel. So that would go from our corporate office all the way to our VPC. 

19
00:01:55,015 --> 00:01:59,915
That way, right, everything that we send between our office and the VPC goes through this tunnel 

20
00:02:00,015 --> 00:02:06,915
and is therefore automatically encrypted and nice and secure. And you know what? 

21
00:02:07,015 --> 00:02:12,915
Of the two options, I don't know like 99. whatever % of the time, option 2 is going to be the one 

22
00:02:13,015 --> 00:02:19,915
and that's the deal with AWS VPNs. We take our office, so branch office, home office, corporate HQ, 

23
00:02:20,015 --> 00:02:24,915
whatever, right, and we lash it up to our VPC over a VPN connection. 

24
00:02:25,015 --> 00:02:30,915
And boom, right, in one fell swoop we've made all communications between the two secure. 

25
00:02:31,015 --> 00:02:37,915
How come? Well like we just said, this connection between the two sites here, it's secure, IPsec secure, 

26
00:02:38,015 --> 00:02:45,915
if that means anything to you. Basically, all traffic, so in both directions, is encrypted using IPsec. 

27
00:02:46,015 --> 00:02:51,915
And I think we've hinted at this, but let's just be clear right now, we sometimes call this connection here 

28
00:02:52,015 --> 00:02:56,915
the tunnel. I don't know, how's about this for an analogy, so we're connecting via the internet, yeah, 

29
00:02:57,015 --> 00:03:02,915
and we know everyone's on the internet including the bad guys. Well, to keep the bad guys from spying 

30
00:03:03,015 --> 00:03:10,915
on our chatter, we create this tunnel and then you can only get in and out of the tunnel from either end. 

31
00:03:11,015 --> 00:03:15,915
But each end is already secure, right, or it should be, so in our VPC we'll be using things like NACLs 

32
00:03:16,015 --> 00:03:21,915
and security groups and the likes, and then over in our remote office we'll be using similar stuff, 

33
00:03:22,015 --> 00:03:28,915
or we should be. The point being, the bad guys out here are outside of our tunnel and from outside, 

34
00:03:29,015 --> 00:03:33,915
you can't see or get in, so a bit like, and I did say we were going to get an analogy here, so I don't know, 

35
00:03:34,015 --> 00:03:39,915
a bit like you know how famous people travel around in big old cars with blacked out windows so you can't 

36
00:03:40,015 --> 00:03:44,915
see in from the outside? Well it's a bit like that. We're all using the same roads and the likes, 

37
00:03:45,015 --> 00:03:49,915
but you can see straight into the likes of my car, right? So you can see who's inside, what the kids are 

38
00:03:50,015 --> 00:03:55,915
watching on their iPads or DVD players, probably see my wife having a sleep in the passenger seat, 

39
00:03:56,015 --> 00:04:00,915
but cars with blacked out windows, good luck seeing what's going on inside of them. 

40
00:04:01,015 --> 00:04:07,915
Well a VPN tunnel it's a bit like that. We're all traveling about on the internet, yeah, but VPN tunnels 

41
00:04:08,015 --> 00:04:15,915
are encrypted so if you're on the outside you can't see in. Okay, now in a way, right, the office location here, 

42
00:04:16,015 --> 00:04:24,915
well it becomes almost like just another subnet within our VPC and that is massive, right? 

43
00:04:25,015 --> 00:04:30,915
It literally means that resources in each network, so from either end of the tunnel, can access resources 

44
00:04:31,015 --> 00:04:39,915
in the other network as if they were set right by each other, the key being using private IPs, yes. 

45
00:04:40,015 --> 00:04:46,915
No more having to assign public IPs to resources that you only want to use internally. 

46
00:04:47,015 --> 00:04:54,915
And also, this VPN, right, it's a permanent, always up, highly available, encrypted tunnel between the office here 

47
00:04:55,015 --> 00:05:02,915
and our AWS VPC. Now that is a far cry, okay, from the flaky old VPN connections that I relied on 

48
00:05:03,015 --> 00:05:08,915
as an IT support engineer all those years ago back in the early days of my career. 

49
00:05:09,015 --> 00:05:14,915
The kind of VPNs we're working with here with AWS, they are rock solid, they're nothing like the VPNs 

50
00:05:15,015 --> 00:05:20,915
of the bad old days. Anyway, that's the high level, okay. Now, let's go and drill down a bit to the actual 

51
00:05:21,015 --> 00:05:24,015
bits and pieces that we need to get it all working.
