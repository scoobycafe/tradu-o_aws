Ok, bem-vindos a este curso sobre AWS VPC Operations. Obrigado por escolher o curso e posso dizer, um especial

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,9
bem-vindo de volta para quem tomou qualquer um dos meus cursos anteriores e está voltando para mais. 

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,9
Sinceramente, aprecio o seu apoio. Agora então, oh sim, 

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,9
Amazon Web Services. Quero dizer, sem dúvida, uma das plataformas de tecnologias mais legais e mais importantes 

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:38,9
no mundo, como sempre. Quero dizer, é mágico, tão maciçamente legal, mas literalmente moldando o futuro do mundo de TI. 

6
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,9
E dentro da AWS, nuvens privadas virtuais estão lá no centro. 

7
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,9
They're a proper foundational building block, I'd say right. If you want to be any good at AWS, you have got to 

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:59,9
know VPCs and I love them, right. I mean, using AWS and VPCs you can literally build yourself your own 

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,9
world class data center for virtual machines in the cloud and it's so flippin' easy and cheap. 

10
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,9
So just to set some expectations, right, we're going to go from literally nothing 

11
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,9
like a blank canvas, right, so no previous experience with AWS is needed, and we're going to go all the way 

12
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,9
through building a work VPC, like that data center in the cloud I just mentioned. 

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,9
So we'll build multiple networks or subnets in different locations for high availability, we'll configure 

14
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:37,9
high speed, highly available internet access, and we'll build load balancers and VPN connections, and all 

15
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,9
that kind of stuff, right. And while we're doing it, we'll play around with virtual machines and we'll 

16
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,9
share some simple web servers to help round out the demos in the labs that we do. 

17
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:55,9
Oh, and we'll secure it alright with some fundamental security technologies that Amazon provides for us. 

18
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,9
And you know what? It's going to be something like, I don't know, 3, 4, 5 hour course, we'll see, 

19
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:07,9
but the point being, in the space of like less than a handful of hours we're going to build a full on working 

20
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:16,9
secured data center of sorts, right, in the cloud. So highly available, high performance, running virtual machines. 

21
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:23,9
And like I said, literally for pennies. And you know what? I'm like still amazed by that because when I cut 

22
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,9
my teeth in IT, that kind of thing took months or years and it cost an arm and a leg. 

23
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,9
So I'm really excited to be teaching this course and I'm really excited for you. 

24
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,9
I think it's going to be the bizzo, an awesome course about an awesome technology, perfect combination. 

25
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Okay now then, a quick bit about me before we rock and roll with the course.
