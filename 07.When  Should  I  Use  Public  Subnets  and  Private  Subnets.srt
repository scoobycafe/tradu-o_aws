Okay, I think I'll take one more question. Yep. Hello governor, so when you think I should use public subnets 

2
00:00:08,605 --> 00:00:15,505
and when should I use private subnets? Okay, so this is a bit of a tricky one, I mean it's the kind of question 

3
00:00:15,605 --> 00:00:21,505
that deserves a, well that depends answer. But that sucks, right, and I'm hardly going to say that. 

4
00:00:21,605 --> 00:00:28,505
Though it is try, it really does depend. That all said though, I'd say a good general rule is to use 

5
00:00:28,605 --> 00:00:36,505
public subnets sparingly. Basically, right, anything you put in a public subnet has a route to the internet 

6
00:00:36,605 --> 00:00:43,505
and it's often going to have a public IP, and that combination is going to make it more open to attacks. 

7
00:00:43,605 --> 00:00:49,505
If you can, right, maybe try and rig things up so that you only stick like elastic load balancers, 

8
00:00:49,605 --> 00:00:54,505
firewall instances, proxy servers, that kind of stuff in public subnets. 

9
00:00:54,605 --> 00:01:01,505
Maybe web servers if you need to, yeah. Then, stick everything else into private subnets, where there's no 

10
00:01:01,605 --> 00:01:07,505
route to the internet and they don't have public IPs. I don't know if that's a good answer or not, 

11
00:01:07,605 --> 00:01:13,505
but I do reckon it's a pretty good rule of thumb, you won't go far wrong by sticking to it. 

12
00:01:13,605 --> 00:01:17,505
Alright then, thanks everyone for your time participating in the course. 

13
00:01:17,605 --> 00:01:20,505
Genuinely, genuinely do appreciate it. 

14
00:01:20,605 --> 00:01:24,605
Feel free to stick around for the quick summary and what's next module.
