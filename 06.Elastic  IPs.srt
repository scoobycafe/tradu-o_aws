1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,866
So I'm guessing right, for most production apps and the likes 

2
00:00:04,966 --> 00:00:10,866
you're going to want persistent public IPs, at least for some of your internet facing systems. 

3
00:00:10,966 --> 00:00:16,866
Maybe you need some of your clients to internally white list some public IPs so that when you come talking to them 

4
00:00:16,966 --> 00:00:23,866
they can trust you. Well public IPs, like we've just been working with, are definitely not the answer to that. 

5
00:00:23,966 --> 00:00:28,866
They don't belong to you and they change every time an instance reboots. 

6
00:00:28,966 --> 00:00:35,866
So what we really want are what Amazon calls elastic IPs. Now these puppies are the same as public IPs 

7
00:00:35,966 --> 00:00:42,866
in that obviously they're kosher publically routable addresses and we've still no control over which particular 

8
00:00:42,966 --> 00:00:49,866
addresses we get, but they are ours to keep. And bouncing an instance isn't going to cause it's elastic IP address 

9
00:00:49,966 --> 00:00:58,866
to change. In fact, the only time that an elastic IP gets released back to Amazon is if we explicitly say so. 

10
00:00:58,966 --> 00:01:01,866
So to get one, we jump over here to elastic IPs 

11
00:01:01,966 --> 00:01:09,866
and what the heck, I haven't got any. Well I'll tell you why in just a sec, but we just go Allocate New Address 

12
00:01:09,966 --> 00:01:13,866
and there we go. So this is here is why I've not got any right now. 

13
00:01:13,966 --> 00:01:17,866
I've obviously had them in the past, but once I'm done with them and I've trashed the instances they map to 

14
00:01:17,966 --> 00:01:23,866
I give them back. Because while they're in use you don't get charged, although actually, I think you do 

15
00:01:23,966 --> 00:01:28,866
if you've got maybe more than one per instance or something like that, but I'd check the latest pricing info. 

16
00:01:28,966 --> 00:01:36,866
But once they're not in use there is a small charge to pay. Anyway, we want one so we'll say yes thanks 

17
00:01:36,966 --> 00:01:43,866
and it's just thinking and there it is. Now all we need to do is go associate it with an instance 

18
00:01:43,966 --> 00:01:48,866
or an elastic network interface. For simplicity sake, okay, we're going to attach it to the instance 

19
00:01:48,966 --> 00:01:55,866
that we just fired up a second ago. But normally, not normally, but certainly the more powerful option 

20
00:01:55,966 --> 00:02:02,866
is to associate it with an elastic network interface and all that is is well, a network card, but one that 

21
00:02:02,966 --> 00:02:07,866
we can associate and re-associate with pretty much any instance we want. 

22
00:02:07,966 --> 00:02:14,866
So if we were to associate an elastic IP with an ENI, that's an elastic network interface, we can attach 

23
00:02:14,966 --> 00:02:21,866
and detach that interface from different instances easy as pie, though stating the obvious I hope, 

24
00:02:21,966 --> 00:02:25,866
it can only be attached to one instance at a time. It's pretty powerful, but we're not going to get 

25
00:02:25,966 --> 00:02:33,866
sidetracked right now. So yes and there we go. It we jump back over to EC2, see I told you that shortcut 

26
00:02:33,966 --> 00:02:41,866
would save us some time, and we select our instance, well see here how the public IP and the elastic IP 

27
00:02:41,966 --> 00:02:52,866
are both populated with the same address. So, for reliable, persistent, public IP addresses we need elastic IPs. 

28
00:02:52,966 --> 00:02:58,866
These get assigned to our VPC and then we can assign them to instances or elastic network interfaces. 

29
00:02:58,966 --> 00:03:03,866
And again, as far as our instances are concerned, they work the same as public IPs, meaning Linux or Windows 

30
00:03:03,966 --> 00:03:10,866
or whatever knows nothing about them. It's all magically and invisibly mapped on the internet gateway. 

31
00:03:10,966 --> 00:03:16,866
So let's say, okay, generally speaking, elastic IPs are where it's at for publically routable IPs. 

32
00:03:16,966 --> 00:03:20,866
Definitely what you want if you need something persistent and reliable. 

33
00:03:20,966 --> 00:03:28,866
I've got a little note here as well saying, at the time of recording at least, there is a limit of five per VPC. 

34
00:03:28,966 --> 00:03:32,866
And you know what? I reckon that's all I've got to say on public subnets. 

35
00:03:32,966 --> 00:03:36,966
Next up, we'll have a quick look at how we configure private subnets for accessing the internet.
