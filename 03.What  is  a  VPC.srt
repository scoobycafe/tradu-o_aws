1
00:00:01,223 --> 00:00:07,123
Well when Amazon was first launched, like back in the mid 2000s, there was just the S3 object store 

2
00:00:07,223 --> 00:00:17,123
and the EC2 virtual machine platform and it's like, oh yeah. As it was, it was just too little for a lot 

3
00:00:17,223 --> 00:00:23,123
of potential customers, especially, right, established businesses and enterprises. 

4
00:00:23,223 --> 00:00:27,123
You see, most established companies were used to their own data centers 

5
00:00:27,223 --> 00:00:32,123
where they owned the service, storage, and networking and they were in full control of the lot. 

6
00:00:32,223 --> 00:00:38,123
Then enter EC2 as a virtual machine computing platform and suddenly not only were the servers and the likes 

7
00:00:38,223 --> 00:00:45,123
not theirs, but they had precious little control over them too, especially in the networking space. 

8
00:00:45,223 --> 00:00:53,123
So it was like, spin up an EC2 instance, a virtual machine, yeah, question, what's it's IP address going to be? 

9
00:00:53,223 --> 00:01:01,123
Answer, uh, well, look that's just not a good answer okay. So very cool, yeah. 

10
00:01:01,223 --> 00:01:10,123
Lots of shortcomings also, yeah. Well here entereth VPCs. These let us build pretty much our own virtual 

11
00:01:10,223 --> 00:01:14,123
data center in AWS and we'll see all of this in just a sec, right. 

12
00:01:14,223 --> 00:01:21,123
But for instance, we get to choose the network range for our entire VPC and then we're free to carve that up 

13
00:01:21,223 --> 00:01:28,123
into as many subnets as we want. But not only that, we can put these subnets in whichever availability zones 

14
00:01:28,223 --> 00:01:36,123
we want and that is massive, right. It means we can say things like, okay I want a couple of web servers 

15
00:01:36,223 --> 00:01:42,123
for performance and availability and then choose to deploy one into a subnet that let's say in availability zone 

16
00:01:42,223 --> 00:01:50,123
1A and the other into a subnet that's in availability zone 1B. Then if 1A goes away, so like the whole 

17
00:01:50,223 --> 00:01:56,123
availability zone or maybe just the EC2 service, yeah, who cares, we're cool. 

18
00:01:56,223 --> 00:02:03,123
1B is still up and we're still in business. But it's not just that, on each of these subnets, we can lash 

19
00:02:03,223 --> 00:02:09,123
network access control lists just like we do on routers and firewalls in our corporate data center networks 

20
00:02:09,223 --> 00:02:15,123
and before long, this is starting to look a whole lot like a regular corporate or data center network, 

21
00:02:15,223 --> 00:02:22,123
which is a huge driver for adoption. You see, by making a VPC look and feel a lot like a traditional network 

22
00:02:22,223 --> 00:02:27,123
a bunch more customers are going to deploy it. Now I don't want to waffle, I really want to get cracking 

23
00:02:27,223 --> 00:02:33,123
and show you, but just maybe 1 more minute of your time, okay, before we get into it, I want to give you 

24
00:02:33,223 --> 00:02:36,223
a couple of warnings.
