00:00:00,599 --> 00:00:11,068
Alright, so thanks to my insane ability to bend space time, the marvelous video editing, our VPC is 

2
00:00:11,168 --> 00:00:19,068
successfully created. But I kid you not here, okay, this is like one of the understatements of the technology era, 

3
00:00:19,168 --> 00:00:25,068
seriously. I mean I just can't overemphasize what we've just done here. 

4
00:00:25,168 --> 00:00:30,068
We should probably be running up and down the street naked, though obviously that's not an official 

5
00:00:30,168 --> 00:00:36,068
recommendation from Pluralsight, but do let me tell you why it's such an understatement. 

6
00:00:36,168 --> 00:00:40,068
We have literally built ourselves a world class data center here. 

7
00:00:40,168 --> 00:00:45,068
I just can't say it any other way. No word of a lie. I mean we've got, what have we got? 

8
00:00:45,168 --> 00:00:52,068
We've got world class physical data center facilities behind everything that we've just created, so stuff like 

9
00:00:52,168 --> 00:00:57,068
world class air con, world class power and power management, world class cabling, world class 

10
00:00:57,168 --> 00:01:05,068
internet access, you name it, the whole shebang is backed by Amazon's world class data center infrastructures. 

11
00:01:05,168 --> 00:01:10,068
It's not like you've just carved out for yourself some resources from the machines in my home lab, 

12
00:01:10,168 --> 00:01:19,068
no, no, no, you have got a virtual data center sitting on top of world class highly available physical infrastructure. 

13
00:01:19,168 --> 00:01:24,068
In fact I'm selling our achievement short, right? Depending on what your choices were when we were building 

14
00:01:24,168 --> 00:01:30,068
the VPC back there, you might well have built yourself two world class data centers and with high speed, 

15
00:01:30,168 --> 00:01:36,068
highly available links between them. This is seriously a monumental achievement. 

16
00:01:36,168 --> 00:01:43,068
And to make it even better, how much has it cost us so far? Zilch, nothing, well, okay so that NAT instance 

17
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:48,068
is probably costing us a penny or so, right, but you grock, right. 

18
00:01:48,168 --> 00:01:54,068
We just built ourselves a world class data infrastructure in like a couple of minutes for an absolute steal 

19
00:01:54,168 --> 00:02:00,068
and we hardly had to know anything about data center design. I mean how is that possible? 

20
00:02:00,168 --> 00:02:07,068
I need to calm down, but it's pretty impressive in my book. I mean, I remember back in the day, right, 

21
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:13,068
racking and stacking physical equipment, having contractors in to pull cabling, test AC equipment, 

22
00:02:13,168 --> 00:02:19,068
pulling up floor tiles, cutting my fingers and hands on like ridiculous server rails, and patching cables 

23
00:02:19,168 --> 00:02:26,068
behind a bunch of servers and switches that were pumping out hot air into my face like I stood beneath 

24
00:02:26,168 --> 00:02:31,068
a space shuttle during a take-off. Oh yeah, those were the days, well no more. 

25
00:02:31,168 --> 00:02:37,068
We just built ourselves a cloud based data center there that rivals, and you know what, no doubt surpasses 

26
00:02:37,168 --> 00:02:43,068
anything that I have ever been involved with building with my own hands. 

27
00:02:43,168 --> 00:02:48,068
The one caveat of course, while I'm saying all of this impressive sounding stuff, you and I actually have 

28
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:54,068
really no way of knowing the details behind what we've created. What I mean is, right, we can't walk 

29
00:02:54,168 --> 00:02:59,068
up to an Amazon data center and say, hey don't mind me, I'm just coming in to inspect the kit that my stuff 

30
00:02:59,168 --> 00:03:06,068
is running on. No, uh uh, so really while we know Amazon has got awesome facilities, right, we have no 

31
00:03:06,168 --> 00:03:12,068
visibility into what kind of tests and maintenance and anything like that that Amazon might or might not 

32
00:03:12,168 --> 00:03:16,068
be carrying out. Like just for instance, okay, a bunch of companies I've worked with in the past 

33
00:03:16,168 --> 00:03:23,068
have done things like annual power maintenance tests, UPS tests, all of that kind of jazz, yeah. 

34
00:03:23,168 --> 00:03:27,068
Making sure that the physical facilities and kit are well oiled and work as they should. 

35
00:03:27,168 --> 00:03:32,068
Now don't get me wrong, I'm not saying you should massively sweat over this, we can assume that Amazon 

36
00:03:32,168 --> 00:03:39,068
does this kind of stuff, okay, it's just no longer looming on our radars, which if you've ever been involved 

37
00:03:39,168 --> 00:03:44,068
in any stuff like that before, you are going to know is a good thing. 

38
00:03:44,168 --> 00:03:48,068
One less thing to plan and stress over, yeah. But you know what? 

39
00:03:48,168 --> 00:03:52,068
If your company has never bothered with stuff like that before, then anything that you do get like that 

40
00:03:52,168 --> 00:03:59,068
from Amazon behind the scenes is a total bonus. Point is though, what kind of testing are Amazon really doing? 

41
00:03:59,168 --> 00:04:05,068
I don't know. Anyway, never mind that. Give yourselves a well deserved pat on the back while we review 

42
00:04:05,168 --> 00:04:08,168
just exactly what we've built for ourselves.
