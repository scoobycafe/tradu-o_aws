1
00:00:00,599 --> 00:00:08,187
So, every VPC gets one of these crazy cryptic AWS names, but see how we can see the friendly name here as well? 

2
00:00:08,287 --> 00:00:15,187
Seriously, name your stuff or you're going to lose your mind. We've got state information, the network 

3
00:00:15,287 --> 00:00:22,187
that we assigned it, and then DHCP options set, this one's new to us. 

4
00:00:22,287 --> 00:00:28,187
Well, you know how, actually maybe you don't, okay, come on let's just back up a smidge. 

5
00:00:28,287 --> 00:00:36,187
I suppose, right, what DHCP is most famous for is dynamically assigning IP addresses to devices on a network, 

6
00:00:36,287 --> 00:00:41,187
so every machine on an IP network needs an IP address in order to communicate. 

7
00:00:41,287 --> 00:00:48,187
Well, instead of ours manually assigning every machine a unique address, most of the time we just conscript DHCP 

8
00:00:48,287 --> 00:00:56,187
into managing all of that for us. So we give DHCP a pool of IP addresses and pretty much say, hey 

9
00:00:56,287 --> 00:01:02,187
any time a new system appears on the network and asks for an address, go ahead and lease it one. 

10
00:01:02,287 --> 00:01:07,187
Bingo. And it takes care of a bunch of other stuff too like making sure that we don't assign the same address 

11
00:01:07,287 --> 00:01:15,187
to two devices and all of that jazz. And that's cool and all, but DHCP, oh, dynamic host configuration protocol, 

12
00:01:15,287 --> 00:01:21,187
in case you're wondering what it stands for, well it can assign a bunch more than just IP addresses. 

13
00:01:21,287 --> 00:01:26,187
So let' take a look at this options set, handy those little hyper links. 

14
00:01:26,287 --> 00:01:35,187
Well, we can see how this options set is also going to assign a domain name of eu-west-1.compute.internal 

15
00:01:35,287 --> 00:01:41,187
and it's going to tell the instances to use, well, as the name clearly suggests, Amazon's own DNS servers. 

16
00:01:41,287 --> 00:01:48,187
In fact, Amazon provided DNS is actually a DNS server that sits on the second address in your VPC's network, 

17
00:01:48,287 --> 00:01:59,187
so in our VPC with 10.0.0.0/16, it's going to be sitting on 10.0.0.2. 

18
00:01:59,287 --> 00:02:02,187
But I'm getting ahead of myself here, so we'll park that for now. 

19
00:02:02,287 --> 00:02:10,187
What I'm saying though is that DHCP options set let us do stuff like, well you know what, let's just go and see. 

20
00:02:10,287 --> 00:02:18,187
Okay, so we could say, well let's do this first. Okay, so we could say, intechwetrustpodcast.com, 

21
00:02:18,287 --> 00:02:25,187
so that all of our instances get a host name in the intechwetrustpodcast.com domain, try saying that. 

22
00:02:25,287 --> 00:02:31,187
We could point it to Google's famous DNS server and we can point it to an NTP server for accurate time too, 

23
00:02:31,287 --> 00:02:38,187
and I totally just made that address up, right. And seriously, right, if you need to configure nasty old 

24
00:02:38,287 --> 00:02:44,187
NetBIOS stuff, oh man, you really want to drag yourself out of the 90's. 

25
00:02:44,287 --> 00:02:48,187
So a bunch of stuff that they can manage and configure, okay, but it's worth knowing. 

26
00:02:48,287 --> 00:02:57,187
DHCP options sets are associated with your AWS account. So they're not limited to the scope of let's say 

27
00:02:57,287 --> 00:03:06,187
a VPC or a region or anything like that, no, and it's totally possible to have multiple sets of DHCP options set, 

28
00:03:06,287 --> 00:03:12,187
try saying that, good grief, but any VPC can only have one assigned to it. 

29
00:03:12,287 --> 00:03:25,187
So I can't assign two DHCP options sets to this new podcast VPC, but I totally can assign this single, 

30
00:03:25,287 --> 00:03:31,187
I'm just going to call it a set this time, to multiple VPCs. In fact, that's actually how I've got things now. 

31
00:03:31,287 --> 00:03:36,187
Hopefully that made sense, if it didn't, right, rewind about 30 seconds and listen to it again, if it still 

32
00:03:36,287 --> 00:03:43,187
doesn't make sense after that, then call me out on Twitter and we can chat about it live. 

33
00:03:43,287 --> 00:03:47,187
But for the crappy part, why oh why is there always a crappy part? 

34
00:03:47,287 --> 00:03:52,187
Even in like the awesome world of AWS there's still annoying stuff. 

35
00:03:52,287 --> 00:03:57,187
Though, I've got to be careful here, I could be totally wrong about this by the time that you're watching the course. 

36
00:03:57,287 --> 00:04:03,187
But at the time of recording, once you create a DHCP options set, you can't modify it. 

37
00:04:03,287 --> 00:04:11,187
In fact, look, there's no modify option, just delete. Alright, if we go back to our VPC again, oh yeah, 

38
00:04:11,287 --> 00:04:19,187
one more thing about DHCP options sets. I'm taking loads more time here on VPCs than I was expecting to. 

39
00:04:19,287 --> 00:04:26,187
If we change the DHCP options set that we've got associated with a VPC, we don't necessarily need to reboot 

40
00:04:26,287 --> 00:04:33,187
our instances. So what happens is, right, when an instance gets its IP config from a DHCP option set 

41
00:04:33,287 --> 00:04:37,187
it gets it on a lease and then every so often it needs to renew that lease. 

42
00:04:37,287 --> 00:04:45,187
Well, when that time comes to renew the lease, any instance is going to pick up the new options. 

43
00:04:45,287 --> 00:04:52,187
There we go, DHCP options sets. Now route table, just a quick and dirty for now, okay. 

44
00:04:52,287 --> 00:04:57,187
Route tables basically tell us how to navigate around our VPC and after the internet as well, which we'll see 

45
00:04:57,287 --> 00:05:02,187
in the next module. Think of them as kind of like maps or directions, yeah. 

46
00:05:02,287 --> 00:05:08,187
Then we've got network ACL, another one that we're going to cover later, but for now it's basically a list of what 

47
00:05:08,287 --> 00:05:15,187
traffic gets allowed and what traffic gets blocked. Tenancy, we already know about that. 

48
00:05:15,287 --> 00:05:21,187
And then finally, DNS resolution and DNS host names. Do we want our hosts to be able to look up DNS names 

49
00:05:21,287 --> 00:05:30,187
and resolve them to IP addresses? And then do we want instances in this VPC to get assigned DNS host names? 

50
00:05:30,287 --> 00:05:36,187
So map their IP addresses to friendlier, more readable DNS names? 

51
00:05:36,287 --> 00:05:43,187
Well, we want yes on both of these counts. So if we go up to Actions up here, Edit DNS Hostnames, 

52
00:05:43,287 --> 00:05:46,287
Yes, and Save. Wowzers! Finally, we can go and create some subnets.
