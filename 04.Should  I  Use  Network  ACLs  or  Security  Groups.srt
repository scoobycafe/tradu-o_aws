1
00:00:00,599 --> 00:00:08,195
Anybody else with a question? Yeah, good day mate. Brad here from Australia. 

2
00:00:08,295 --> 00:00:13,195
These security groups and network access control lists, they sound a bit similar, mate. 

3
00:00:13,295 --> 00:00:20,195
Which of the two should I be using? Hi Brad. Just real quick actually, did you by any chance see England 

4
00:00:20,295 --> 00:00:24,195
play Australia in the Ashes recently? That's cricket for anyone out there who doesn't know. 

5
00:00:24,295 --> 00:00:31,195
Anyway, the answer to that question is simple. Both. You should definitely use both. 

6
00:00:31,295 --> 00:00:37,195
And more, right. The idea being, there's no single technology that on its own is going to keep your 

7
00:00:37,295 --> 00:00:43,195
infrastructure safe. We really do need to deploy multiple layers of security, defense in-depth, yeah. 

8
00:00:43,295 --> 00:00:49,195
So we protected the subnet level with NACLs and we've protected the instance level with security groups. 

9
00:00:49,295 --> 00:00:55,195
Yeah, they might take a bit of learning and yeah, no doubt, they're going to be a bit of a pain at first, 

10
00:00:55,295 --> 00:00:59,195
in fact you're probably going to find yourself tripping over them from time to time, you know, like 

11
00:00:59,295 --> 00:01:04,195
you're going to be wondering something's not working or why you can't connect to an instance or something, yeah. 

12
00:01:04,295 --> 00:01:08,195
And it's going to turn out to be because of a NACL rule or a security group rule. 

13
00:01:08,295 --> 00:01:12,195
And you might even be tempted to turn the blasted things off. But don't. 

14
00:01:12,295 --> 00:01:19,195
Honestly, don't. They are proper insurance policies. And you know Murphy's law says that the day that you 

15
00:01:19,295 --> 00:01:22,195
cancel your home insurance your house is going to burn to the ground? 

16
00:01:22,295 --> 00:01:28,195
Well don't let the equivalent happen to your VPC. Get to know NACLs and get to know security groups 

17
00:01:28,295 --> 00:01:35,195
and use them properly. And this is a good idea s well, right, have some standards, yeah, and maybe document them 

18
00:01:35,295 --> 00:01:42,195
and who knows, even stick to them, yeah. Just so that you've got a bit of a pattern to how you use them, 

19
00:01:42,295 --> 00:01:46,195
and I'm talking simple things like what's your strategy for applying security groups, yeah? 

20
00:01:46,295 --> 00:01:53,195
Is it one per instance or one per instance type like web servers or one security group per application tier 

21
00:01:53,295 --> 00:01:57,195
or whatever, yeah? Just do it, right. I can't stress this enough. 

22
00:01:57,295 --> 00:02:04,195
Security is not optional anymore and NACLs and security groups really do complement each other. 

23
00:02:04,295 --> 00:02:09,195
So don't cheat and just try to use one. You know what, right, these are just the basics, the minimum, yeah. 

24
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:15,195
You can totally use like third party tools as well, intrusion prevention systems, you can encrypt 

25
00:02:15,295 --> 00:02:20,195
bits and pieces, you might want to run antivirus, SC Linus, AppArmor. 

26
00:02:20,295 --> 00:02:26,195
There's tons of stuff. Take security seriously. But yeah, of the two major things that we've covered 

27
00:02:26,295 --> 00:02:29,295
in the course, NACLs and security groups, use them both and use them wisely.
