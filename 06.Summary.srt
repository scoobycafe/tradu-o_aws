00:00:00,599 --> 00:00:03,9
Okay, what did we learn in this module? 

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,368
Well two things basically, first up VPNs. 

3
00:00:08,468 --> 00:00:15,368
A cost effective and convenient way to lash our existing sites and networks up to our AWS VPC. 

4
00:00:15,468 --> 00:00:21,368
But, using the internet to string the two together. Though that's like not the end of the world, right, 

5
00:00:21,468 --> 00:00:28,368
these are proper site to site IPsec VPNs, so they're robust, reliable, and secure. 

6
00:00:28,468 --> 00:00:33,368
But seeing as how they use the internet in the middle, they also object to the kind of latency and 

7
00:00:33,468 --> 00:00:37,368
throughput challenges that we all love about the internet. But you know what? 

8
00:00:37,468 --> 00:00:42,368
Don't let that put you off totally. They really can be the bizzo. 

9
00:00:42,468 --> 00:00:47,368
We also pointed out, right, that once these VPN connections are up and working, we can then connect 

10
00:00:47,468 --> 00:00:54,368
to our instances in AWS from our office networks using private IPs. 

11
00:00:54,468 --> 00:00:58,368
And this is cracking, right? It makes them look and feel like regular old services that are on our 

12
00:00:58,468 --> 00:01:04,368
corporate network rather than distant cloud services that we need to access over the internet. 

13
00:01:04,468 --> 00:01:12,368
It's really a good thing. Then, we looked at Direct Connect, kind of like the VPN's big brother. 

14
00:01:12,468 --> 00:01:18,368
These, right, allow us to run dedicated fiber connections directly from our infrastructure into AWS 

15
00:01:18,468 --> 00:01:25,368
or actually via an approved partner. But the point being, we're on dedicated fiber links now 

16
00:01:25,468 --> 00:01:30,368
and we're not shifting traffic over the internet. As a result, right, these are going to give us much more 

17
00:01:30,468 --> 00:01:37,368
reliable and consistent network performance and most importantly, at least in most cloud computing use cases, 

18
00:01:37,468 --> 00:01:44,368
higher throughput. Now of the two big networking measurements, right, latency and throughput, 

19
00:01:44,468 --> 00:01:49,368
I'd say in the majority of cases, throughput is the killer for cloud computing. 

20
00:01:49,468 --> 00:01:53,368
Because I figure, right, in most cases, high latency is a given, yeah. 

21
00:01:53,468 --> 00:01:58,368
I mean even using Direct Connect, you're not going to get the kind of low latencies that you can get 

22
00:01:58,468 --> 00:02:03,368
if everything's in your own data center. So on your own layer 2 network or your own fiber channel SAN 

23
00:02:03,468 --> 00:02:09,368
or whatever, you're not going to get those kind of latencies. It really is throughput that's the killer. 

24
00:02:09,468 --> 00:02:15,368
I mean, you want to maybe backing up and restoring to S3 or Glacier or something or doing data analytics 

25
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:22,368
on large data stores that you've got in AWS. Latency is usually not even part of the conversation. 

26
00:02:22,468 --> 00:02:28,368
It's all about how much data you can shift back and forth between yourself and AWS. 

27
00:02:28,468 --> 00:02:34,368
Well, if that's the case, Direct Connect can be a proper golden ticket to the cloud for you. 

28
00:02:34,468 --> 00:02:41,368
Anyway, we said we can have both, so Direct Connect and VPNs, but if we do that, the Direct Connect links 

29
00:02:41,468 --> 00:02:47,368
are going to be the preferred ones as long as they're up and then if and when they're down, the VPN 

30
00:02:47,468 --> 00:02:53,368
connection kicks in and saves the day. Well, all good stuff, right? 

31
00:02:53,468 --> 00:03:00,368
Next up, well a change of gears actually. We're going to wrap the course up with a bit of a quick Q and A with me, 

32
00:03:00,468 --> 00:03:06,368
me asking the questions and me giving the answers, how's about that for a rigged set up, yeah? 

33
00:03:06,468 --> 00:03:13,368
A bit like a dictatorship. I'll answer any question, so long as I get to see it first and allow only the easy ones. 

34
00:03:13,468 --> 00:03:20,368
In fact, what am I talking about? I even wrote the questions and I get to edit the video, talk about 

35
00:03:20,468 --> 00:03:23,468
an easy ride. Anyway, see you there in the next module.
