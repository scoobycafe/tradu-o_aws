1
00:00:00,599 --> 00:00:07,222
So we've got all of the VPC and subnetty type infrastructure in place to get us out onto the internet, 

2
00:00:07,322 --> 00:00:13,222
but in order for any instances to actually make it out there, they need a public IP and I know it's probably 

3
00:00:13,322 --> 00:00:18,222
not needed, but just in case, okay. Let's build out our analogy of roads and road signs. 

4
00:00:18,322 --> 00:00:26,222
So if our routers and internet gateways are our actual roads, and our route table entries are like our road signs, 

5
00:00:26,322 --> 00:00:32,222
then public IPs, I suppose, are a bit like cars. You're with me, right? 

6
00:00:32,322 --> 00:00:39,222
In order to get out there on the internet or onto the motorway or highway, yeah, our instance needs a public IP 

7
00:00:39,322 --> 00:00:45,222
or a car. Just like you can't take a bike on the motorway, like a pedal bike, yeah, well at least in England 

8
00:00:45,322 --> 00:00:51,222
you can't, well you can't take a private IP onto the internet, you need a public one. 

9
00:00:51,322 --> 00:00:57,222
Okay, well, we have a couple of ways to accomplish that. We can either assign an instance of public IP 

10
00:00:57,322 --> 00:01:03,222
when we create the instance or we can set an attribute on the subnet so that every time we launch an instance 

11
00:01:03,322 --> 00:01:13,222
into that subnet it's going to get one automatically. Right, so if we head over to our public subnet 

12
00:01:13,322 --> 00:01:19,222
and then see here in the Summary tab of it, and in fact look, it's the same for any subnet, right, 

13
00:01:19,322 --> 00:01:29,222
or at least we've got this setting in every subnet. Auto-assign public IP, well we need to set that to yes. 

14
00:01:29,322 --> 00:01:37,222
And there's the option right there or up here in Subnet Actions. And again, look, it couldn't be any simpler, 

15
00:01:37,322 --> 00:01:44,222
one tick in the box and we're in business. Though, I will point out, right, we've no way of controlling 

16
00:01:44,322 --> 00:01:50,222
what IP address gets assigned. Sure it'll be publically routable, but we don't get to choose what the actual 

17
00:01:50,322 --> 00:01:53,322
addresses are. Anyway, should we go and spin up an instance?
