1
00:00:00,599 --> 00:00:08,454
First things first okay, create the VPC. Now we're going to see that a VPC itself is not much more than a name 

2
00:00:08,554 --> 00:00:12,454
and a range of IP addresses or at least that's all that we need to worry about. 

3
00:00:12,554 --> 00:00:18,454
Remember, right, behind the scenes we are carving out for ourselves a portion of Amazon's world class 

4
00:00:18,554 --> 00:00:24,454
data center infrastructure. Anyway okay, we're going to call ours podcast again. 

5
00:00:24,554 --> 00:00:29,454
I deleted the one that we used in the last module and I did a bit of cleaning up. 

6
00:00:29,554 --> 00:00:38,454
Then we'll go with a 10.0 network again. Remember, this /16 means that the first 2 octets are the network address 

7
00:00:38,554 --> 00:00:44,454
and the last 2 octets here are for device addresses. We'll get this bit right, okay, because you know what? 

8
00:00:44,554 --> 00:00:50,454
Like most network hocus pocus, once it's done it is like way to complicated to change. 

9
00:00:50,554 --> 00:00:55,454
So get your CIDR block right because there's no way to come back and change it later. 

10
00:00:55,554 --> 00:01:01,454
Now, I suppose what do I mean when I say get it right? Well, you're going to want to do things like 

11
00:01:01,554 --> 00:01:06,454
make sure that you're not already using this CIDR block somewhere else in your corporate network, even outside 

12
00:01:06,554 --> 00:01:11,454
of AWS, okay. Because if you are and then at some time in the future you come and try and hook that network up 

13
00:01:11,554 --> 00:01:17,454
to AWS file, like a VPN or something, well you're going to have problems. 

14
00:01:17,554 --> 00:01:23,454
So, the moral of the story here, make sure that this CIDR block is unique within your organization, yeah. 

15
00:01:23,554 --> 00:01:28,454
Then tenancy here, yeah, this is just whether or not we want to pay for our own dedicated physical servers 

16
00:01:28,554 --> 00:01:33,454
on the back end or whether we're happy to share. I'm happy to share. 

17
00:01:33,554 --> 00:01:43,454
Okay. Now, remember, a VPC only exists within a region. So here's our VPC and up here, I'm in Ireland, 

18
00:01:43,554 --> 00:01:49,454
true that be. Apologies to any fine Irish people watching, that was my shocking attempt at an Irish accent, 

19
00:01:49,554 --> 00:01:59,454
but if I go to let's say Asia Pac Sydney, good day mate, well we can see here how there's just the default VPC 

20
00:01:59,554 --> 00:02:07,454
in this region. So when building a VPC, make sure that you're in the right region, oh, and if at some time 

21
00:02:07,554 --> 00:02:12,454
in the future you're looking around for your VPC and you can't fine it and you're like, ahh where's my VPC gone? 

22
00:02:12,554 --> 00:02:20,454
Amazon's lost my VPC, my entire world. Well, don't sweat. Well I'm saying don't sweat, at least double check first 

23
00:02:20,554 --> 00:02:26,454
that you're in the right region. I've been there and done that in the past, you know, got the cold sweats 

24
00:02:26,554 --> 00:02:34,454
thinking, where's my VPC gone, it's disappeared. Only then to realize, nah, I was just in the wrong region. 

25
00:02:34,554 --> 00:02:39,454
Okay, point taken I'm sure. Let me get back to the Emerald Isle. 

26
00:02:39,554 --> 00:02:43,554
Okay let's take a look now at some of the VPC related config.
