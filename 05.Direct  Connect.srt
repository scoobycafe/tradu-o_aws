1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:08,401
So, there is another way of hooking your corporate network up to your AWS VPCs and it's like, well certainly 

2
00:00:08,501 --> 00:00:13,401
in my opinion at least, it's the more enterprise class way to do it, the posh way, you know, 

3
00:00:13,501 --> 00:00:21,401
like VPNs are maybe connections for the common man or woman, whereas this, this is for the serious customer. 

4
00:00:21,501 --> 00:00:27,401
So it's like more reliable, gives you better and more consistent throughput, lower latency, just an all around 

5
00:00:27,501 --> 00:00:33,401
better, more high grade option. Oh, and it's called Direct Connect. 

6
00:00:33,501 --> 00:00:36,401
Maybe I should have left that off the slide and given like a drum roll or something. 

7
00:00:36,501 --> 00:00:44,401
And it's called Direct Connect. Anyway, the name's like a total gimme. 

8
00:00:44,501 --> 00:00:50,401
So it tells us pretty much exactly what it does, which is instead of using the internet as the network 

9
00:00:50,501 --> 00:00:57,401
in between our office over here and our VPC, we string a dedicated cable between the two. 

10
00:00:57,501 --> 00:01:02,401
Now that's like the mega high level, of course, and we'll look into the detail in uno momento. 

11
00:01:02,501 --> 00:01:07,401
But to grasp the big picture, that's pretty much what we need. So, get rid of the internet here, 

12
00:01:07,501 --> 00:01:11,401
we don't need that, I mean like it's totally overrated, right? Who needs the internet? 

13
00:01:11,501 --> 00:01:17,401
Anyway, we replace it with a dedicated cable and as simple as that, right, we've got ourselves 

14
00:01:17,501 --> 00:01:22,401
a nice little connection into AWS, but one without all the baggage that comes with the internet, 

15
00:01:22,501 --> 00:01:27,401
so you know, without all the bad guys lurking around every corner trying to nick your data and without 

16
00:01:27,501 --> 00:01:34,401
all of the internet traffic jams at rush hour that give us that like totally random performance. 

17
00:01:34,501 --> 00:01:44,401
Well, Direct Connect makes pretty much all of that go away. But, and there's always a but, for me at least, okay, 

18
00:01:44,501 --> 00:01:50,401
that but lies in the fact that lashing the piece of string or the network circuit between ourselves and AWS, 

19
00:01:50,501 --> 00:01:56,401
ah it's not quite as simple as that diagram makes out. I mean it's not mega hard or anything, but you've got 

20
00:01:56,501 --> 00:02:03,401
to go through a third party, so you can't just run a cable from one of your own routers directly into AWS. 

21
00:02:03,501 --> 00:02:11,401
No. You've got to go through like an AWS Direct Connect access point of sorts or a point of presence or POP, 

22
00:02:11,501 --> 00:02:18,401
but all that basically is is a colo data center that's got dedicated network pipes into AWS. 

23
00:02:18,501 --> 00:02:23,401
So for example, right, I'm in the UK, yeah, meaning a bunch of people that I work with run their AWS stuff 

24
00:02:23,501 --> 00:02:32,401
in the Ireland region, eu-west 1. So, when they need a Direct Connect connection, a Direct Connect connection, 

25
00:02:32,501 --> 00:02:38,401
yeah, try saying that 10 times while chewing on a sweet, but anyway, they tend to use the TeleCity data centers 

26
00:02:38,501 --> 00:02:44,401
in the London Docklands. The reason being, right, TeleCity, who's got a handful of data centers 

27
00:02:44,501 --> 00:02:51,401
in the Docklands area, have got high speed dedicated pipes directly from their own data centers into the 

28
00:02:51,501 --> 00:02:58,401
AWS Ireland region. Now, I know maybe all of you don't have infrastructure backgrounds, so I don't want to assume 

29
00:02:58,501 --> 00:03:03,401
that you just know what all of that stuff is. So, stick with me, right, while I back up just a second. 

30
00:03:03,501 --> 00:03:09,401
A colo data center, right, it's basically a data center facility with space to rent. 

31
00:03:09,501 --> 00:03:14,401
So, a company like TeleCity or Equinix or whoever, right, there's tons of them, yeah. 

32
00:03:14,501 --> 00:03:20,401
Well they build like a mahoosive data center with top notch facilities, all the bells and whistles, yeah, 

33
00:03:20,501 --> 00:03:27,401
and then they rent space out. So maybe they rent out a whole or a room or a cabinet or a caged area, right. 

34
00:03:27,501 --> 00:03:34,401
Each of those being like a mini data center, but each one being sold or rented out to different customers. 

35
00:03:34,501 --> 00:03:40,401
What we end up with is a big old data center with a bunch of different companies using it. 

36
00:03:40,501 --> 00:03:45,401
Anyway, a select group of these colo data centers, and colo is just short for collocation because we have 

37
00:03:45,501 --> 00:03:51,401
multiple companies using them, yeah, well a select group of those have got dedicated network connections 

38
00:03:51,501 --> 00:04:00,401
from their data centers directly into AWS. Magic. So, I guess it's pretty easy to get your head around this, 

39
00:04:00,501 --> 00:04:07,401
right, if you're already in one of those select few colos, in fact actually, if we jump quickly over to our 

40
00:04:07,501 --> 00:04:15,401
AWS console here, we go into Direct Connect down here. Look here, we're in Ireland, right? 

41
00:04:15,501 --> 00:04:22,401
So there's only two colos to choose from, TeleCity and Eircom, I hope I pronounced that right. 

42
00:04:22,501 --> 00:04:29,401
But if we jump over here to US West Oregon, right, oh good option. 

43
00:04:29,501 --> 00:04:36,401
So there's Euqinix and SUPERNAP. Now I say it's a good option, right, because as a geek I've kind of drooled 

44
00:04:36,501 --> 00:04:43,401
over SUPERNAP facilities in the past, proper like, I don't know, uber data centers. 

45
00:04:43,501 --> 00:04:48,401
Very cool to Google and research some time if you're into data centers, SUPERNAP, I'm telling you. 

46
00:04:48,501 --> 00:04:53,401
Anyway, you're usually going to find like a couple of colo options, so those AWS Direct Connect 

47
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:59,401
points of presence, yeah, a couple per region is normal. I don't know, maybe they'll be more in the future, 

48
00:04:59,501 --> 00:05:01,401
but for now it's usually a couple per region. 

49
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:06,401
Anyway, what I was going to say was, if you're already located in one of those, so you've got your infrastructure 

50
00:05:06,501 --> 00:05:11,401
and your kit and your servers and stuff in there, then you kind of sort it or so it would seem. 

51
00:05:11,501 --> 00:05:17,401
I mean, surely it can't be that hard to string up some fiber between some of your kit, already in the colo, yeah, 

52
00:05:17,501 --> 00:05:20,401
over to one of the routers with access to AWS that the colo provides. 

53
00:05:20,501 --> 00:05:25,401
And that's ideal, right? It's basically a fiber cross connect. 

54
00:05:25,501 --> 00:05:29,401
So not wickedly hard. Yeah it's going to cost you and you're going to need some networking know how 

55
00:05:29,501 --> 00:05:34,401
to be able to do it. Because you're already on site, it's pretty simple. 

56
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:38,401
Cool and all, but what if you're not already in one of those sites? 

57
00:05:38,501 --> 00:05:43,401
I don't know, maybe you are in a colo, just not one that's been blessed with connectivity to AWS. 

58
00:05:43,501 --> 00:05:49,401
Well, no massive issue actually, it's still totally doable. All you've got to do is work with a Telco provider, 

59
00:05:49,501 --> 00:05:57,401
so like Colt or AT&T or Verizon or whoever's in your area and on the list of AWS approved partners, 

60
00:05:57,501 --> 00:06:02,401
then what can happen is, these guys can hook you up from your facility or colo into one of those 

61
00:06:02,501 --> 00:06:09,401
Direct Connect POPs. So here's you over her in your colo, right, with no access to Direct Connect. 

62
00:06:09,501 --> 00:06:15,401
But let's say Colt, right, and substitute those guys with whoever's relevant in your area, these guys 

63
00:06:15,501 --> 00:06:22,401
are on the AWS list and have got connectivity into your colo and connectivity into the Direct Connect 

64
00:06:22,501 --> 00:06:27,401
point of presence, meaning they can basically act like a middle man, getting you access over here 

65
00:06:27,501 --> 00:06:33,401
where you need it. Now obviously there's more to it than that, okay, but conceptually, so long as I did 

66
00:06:33,501 --> 00:06:38,401
a half decent job at least, you should pretty grasp the idea of Direct Connect. 

67
00:06:38,501 --> 00:06:43,401
Now, I think we did say that it's an alternative way of getting your office access to your VPC, 

68
00:06:43,501 --> 00:06:52,401
so instead of using a VPN. Meaning, as a result, all access to resources is done via private IPs again. 

69
00:06:52,501 --> 00:06:58,401
So you totally need to make sure that the network addresses of your office and your VPC don't overlap, 

70
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:01,401
because it ain't using the internet, we're on private IPs again here. 

71
00:07:01,501 --> 00:07:07,401
I just can't stress this enough, right, when you're getting started with VPCs, treat them like regular 

72
00:07:07,501 --> 00:07:14,401
corporate networks, make sure they've got their own documented and separate IP ranges. 

73
00:07:14,501 --> 00:07:19,401
Anyway, right, it can also work alongside a VPN, sort of, right. 

74
00:07:19,501 --> 00:07:25,401
It's just got to be in an active passive formation. This means that while your Direct Connect link is up 

75
00:07:25,501 --> 00:07:31,401
that's going to get used and your VPN, your secure connection over the internet, it's going to be ignored. 

76
00:07:31,501 --> 00:07:36,401
But then as soon as your Direct Connect link goes down, your VPN connection kicks in and takes over. 

77
00:07:36,501 --> 00:07:43,401
So the two can work together for high availability. But, right, speaking of Direct Connect links going down, 

78
00:07:43,501 --> 00:07:49,401
they're like totally not redundant by design, okay. So if you want some sort of high redundancy 

79
00:07:49,501 --> 00:07:55,401
within Direct Connect, you're going to need two of them, each with their own dedicated fiber cross connect. 

80
00:07:55,501 --> 00:08:03,401
Now then, to do it, right, Direct Connect has got its own icon and its own link from here in the AWS console. 

81
00:08:03,501 --> 00:08:11,401
Then, under Connections here, we go to Create Connection. Now we give our connection a name (Typing) 

82
00:08:11,501 --> 00:08:18,401
and that'll do for us. Then we get to choose which POP we use, we're in Ireland, so it's either TeleCity 

83
00:08:18,501 --> 00:08:25,401
or Eircom and if they're not an option, then we can hit this link here, but we'll go with TeleCity 

84
00:08:25,501 --> 00:08:30,401
and we'll have a 10Gbps connection please, I mean, 1Gbps it's like so last year, in fact where's the 

85
00:08:30,501 --> 00:08:37,401
100Gbps connections, Amazon? Anyway, we'll create that. Okay so there it is and it's details. 

86
00:08:37,501 --> 00:08:44,401
State, requested. Now then, in the real world, right, like as opposed to the alternative reality that I'm 

87
00:08:44,501 --> 00:08:49,401
creating this course from, well we'd need to go and get the cross connect in place now. 

88
00:08:49,501 --> 00:08:53,401
And that's going to look something like this, okay. We're going to need to speak to our colo or 

89
00:08:53,501 --> 00:08:59,401
network provider and we'll give them the authorization email that we'll get from Amazon. 

90
00:08:59,501 --> 00:09:04,401
Because yeah, we get an authorization email from them now that we're created that connection request. 

91
00:09:04,501 --> 00:09:09,401
And then once we given them that, we go through the motions of physically cabling it all up, yeah. 

92
00:09:09,501 --> 00:09:15,401
Once that's done, that state there is going to change from requested and this Create Virtual Interface 

93
00:09:15,501 --> 00:09:21,401
spot in here, that's going to light up. Then you're going to create a virtual interface for every VPC 

94
00:09:21,501 --> 00:09:28,401
that you want to be reachable over your Direct Connect link. So if you've got four VPCs, you might want to 

95
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:34,401
create four virtual interfaces, assuming you want all four to be reachable over Direct Connect. 

96
00:09:34,501 --> 00:09:39,401
But I'm going to let you down again, that's beyond the scope of this course, because as awesome as my 

97
00:09:39,501 --> 00:09:44,401
consulting company is, yeah, I'm not yet on the Fortune 100 list. 

98
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:49,401
So I've not bothered to get myself kit in the Direct Connect POP yet and plus, from here on in, right, 

99
00:09:49,501 --> 00:09:57,401
it's all networking mumbo jumbo like VLANs and BGP ASNs and router configs and the likes. 

100
00:09:57,501 --> 00:10:02,401
But I reckon, right, that's enough to make us cool with Direct Connect, a rich man or woman's VPN, 

101
00:10:02,501 --> 00:10:06,401
if you will. I don't know, you want a direct connection into AWS? 

102
00:10:06,501 --> 00:10:11,401
You're too important for the internet? Then Direct Connect is the option for you. 

103
00:10:11,501 --> 00:10:15,501
But, charges to apply. And on that note, I think we'll go and summarize what we've learned in this module.
