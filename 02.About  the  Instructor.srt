1
00:00:00,164 --> 00:00:10,064
Right, so I'm Nigel and for those of you who don't know me yet, I love technology, properly love it. 

2
00:00:10,164 --> 00:00:16,064
I think ever since I first programmed my brother's ZX Spectrum 48K, the rubber key version for anyone 

3
00:00:16,164 --> 00:00:22,064
who remembers it, right. Well I think since then I've wanted to spend my life with computers, I just love them. 

4
00:00:22,164 --> 00:00:28,064
I'm fascinated by them. The idea that I can make them do things and then when things go wrong I can dig 

5
00:00:28,164 --> 00:00:34,064
under the covers and fix them, it's a bit like a drug for me. And Amazon Web Services is no different. 

6
00:00:34,164 --> 00:00:40,064
Well, obviously it's massively different to an old Spectrum 48K, right, but the principles and stuff 

7
00:00:40,164 --> 00:00:48,064
are all the same. It is exciting and it's a game changer. Anyway, I love working and playing with technology 

8
00:00:48,164 --> 00:00:54,064
and I love teaching you guys about it. Now aside from technology, I'm really into fitness. 

9
00:00:54,164 --> 00:00:59,064
I play a lot of football, I like lifting weights, riding my bike, running, all that kind of stuff, okay, 

10
00:00:59,164 --> 00:01:06,064
and I support the mighty Sunderland, the greatest Football team in the world. 

11
00:01:06,164 --> 00:01:12,064
Also, I'm a husband to the lovely Jen and I'm father to three girls that are going to change the world, 

12
00:01:12,164 --> 00:01:17,064
if they want to. I know they certainly changed mine. Anyway, I love making these courses for you. 

13
00:01:17,164 --> 00:01:22,064
They're a ton of fun and one of my main objectives, right, is for you guys to have fun watching them. 

14
00:01:22,164 --> 00:01:28,064
I really do want your learning experience to be enjoyable. Okay, and a massive thanks, right, to everyone 

15
00:01:28,164 --> 00:01:34,064
who reaches out and tells me how much they enjoy my courses, and also all those guys who ping me and tell me 

16
00:01:34,164 --> 00:01:39,064
how excited they are when I've created a new one. Thank you so much. 

17
00:01:39,164 --> 00:01:44,064
I love you guys. But on that note actually, right, I really want to make every course that I do better 

18
00:01:44,164 --> 00:01:52,064
than the last one. And to do that, I totally need your help. So yeah, I love all the love that you give my courses, 

19
00:01:52,164 --> 00:01:58,064
honestly I really do, but if there's anything that you reckon I could do better next time, seriously, 

20
00:01:58,164 --> 00:02:01,064
I want you to tell me. So hit the course discussion board 

21
00:02:01,164 --> 00:02:07,064
on Pluralsight.com or ping me on twitter. I really value your feedback and input into my next courses 

22
00:02:07,164 --> 00:02:14,064
and how's about this, right, together we can make the next course better. 

23
00:02:14,164 --> 00:02:19,064
A bit cheese, right? I know, but it's true. You want the next course that I do for you to be better than this one? 

24
00:02:19,164 --> 00:02:21,064
Ping me and help me, right. 

25
00:02:21,164 --> 00:02:29,064
Ah, yeah, I nearly forgot. Also, right, I co-host a weekly podcast called the In Tech We Trust Podcast 

26
00:02:29,164 --> 00:02:34,064
and it's dedicated to infrastructure tech news, so all about keeping you up-to-date with what's going on 

27
00:02:34,164 --> 00:02:40,064
in the infrastructure tech world and we talk about Amazon Web Services and the likes all the time. 

28
00:02:40,164 --> 00:02:45,064
So if you're into this stuff, I recommend you give it a listen. Now then, 

29
00:02:45,164 --> 00:02:51,064
this is how we're going to do this course. In the next module I'm going to do like a super quick high level overview 

30
00:02:51,164 --> 00:02:57,064
of AWS and virtual private clouds, which I'm probably just going to call VPCs from now on. 

31
00:02:57,164 --> 00:03:04,064
Then after that, we're going to build a VPC, but using the wizard, and that works and all, but it's just not 

32
00:03:04,164 --> 00:03:10,064
very good for learning how it all works under the covers. So after that, we're going to hand build a VPC. 

33
00:03:10,164 --> 00:03:16,064
We'll hand build subnets and configure routing, we'll configure access to the internet, we'll lock things down 

34
00:03:16,164 --> 00:03:22,064
with network access control lists and security groups, then we'll start adding some of the cool stuff. 

35
00:03:22,164 --> 00:03:28,064
First up, we'll do elastic load balancers, then we'll configure VPC peering where we hook up some string 

36
00:03:28,164 --> 00:03:34,064
between two VPCs, then after that we'll look at how we hook up remote offices to our VPC using a 

37
00:03:34,164 --> 00:03:40,064
virtual private network or a VPN connection, and when we're done with all that good stuff we'll round out the module 

38
00:03:40,164 --> 00:03:46,064
with a short sharp Q&A session and I've never done one of these before, right, but what I'm going to do is 

39
00:03:46,164 --> 00:03:50,064
I'm going to answer what I see as some of the most common AWS questions. 

40
00:03:50,164 --> 00:03:55,064
And the answers, of course, they'll all just be my opinions, but I don't know, I'm hoping that it might be 

41
00:03:55,164 --> 00:04:01,064
a cool little module. Then that'll be done. Anyway, that's enough of that, right. 

42
00:04:01,164 --> 00:04:06,064
Time to go and actually start learning about AWS virtual private clouds. 

43
00:04:06,164 --> 00:04:12,064
And as we can see here, I'm going to start the ball rolling in the next module by introducing the high level concept 

44
00:04:12,164 --> 00:04:15,164
and running through the major technologies that we're going to be configuring.
