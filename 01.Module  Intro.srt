00:00:00,5 --> 00:00:08,4
Okay then, so in this module we're going to rock and roll with VPNs, virtual private networks. 

2
00:00:08,5 --> 00:00:16,4
But right off the bat, I want to take a sec to define a VPN and then outline how we're going to tackle things. 

3
00:00:16,5 --> 00:00:22,4
So a VPN, okay, it's an acronym for virtual private network. And back in the day, right, so like when I was 

4
00:00:22,5 --> 00:00:28,4
resetting passwords, changing backup tapes, and you know what, pretty much making coffees for my superiors, 

5
00:00:28,5 --> 00:00:35,4
technical superiors yeah, well back then, VPNs were nasty things. 

6
00:00:35,5 --> 00:00:41,4
I mean, I shutter just thinking about them. So the idea was, when people weren't in the office, 

7
00:00:41,5 --> 00:00:47,4
but maybe needed access to company services, I don't know like email or maybe a database or whatever, 

8
00:00:47,5 --> 00:00:53,4
well we needed a way to give them a connection from wherever they were back to the office and that connection 

9
00:00:53,5 --> 00:01:00,4
had to be secure. So it was a bit like this, right? Well in fact, actually when I graduated into being trusted 

10
00:01:00,5 --> 00:01:06,4
enough to be on the IT support on-call router it was exactly like this. 

11
00:01:06,5 --> 00:01:12,4
So I don't know what it was, it was like once every 4 or 5 weeks I'd be anointed with the possession of the 

12
00:01:12,5 --> 00:01:19,4
on-call mobile phone and a laptop, the likes of which would be almost unrecognizable these days, 

13
00:01:19,5 --> 00:01:25,4
a proper honking piece of plastic, but you know what? Doubled as a pretty good weight for dead lifting. 

14
00:01:25,5 --> 00:01:30,4
But it had a build in modem and then, right, whenever there was a problem with any of the company's server 

15
00:01:30,5 --> 00:01:37,4
infrastructure outside of office hours, I'd fire up the laptop, then obviously I'd wait 5 minutes for it to boot, 

16
00:01:37,5 --> 00:01:43,4
then I'd dial back to the office where we had a good old Nortel Contivity VPN concentrator. 

17
00:01:43,5 --> 00:01:50,4
Now then, this combination of the laptop with the Nortel VPN Client, the internet, and let's just call 

18
00:01:50,5 --> 00:01:57,4
it a VPN router here, this combo let us create what's called an encrypted tunnel from my laptop all the way 

19
00:01:57,5 --> 00:02:07,4
through the internet to the corporate network, basically a secure, shall we call it, virtual private network. 

20
00:02:07,5 --> 00:02:14,4
And while it was good in theory, right, in practice probably due to like the 56K modem speeds and the likes, 

21
00:02:14,5 --> 00:02:21,4
it was a pig, seriously, it was absolutely pants. Now I don't want to waffle okay, so story time is over, 

22
00:02:21,5 --> 00:02:29,4
but the principle is this, VPNs are all about tunneling a secure connection over the internet from one point 

23
00:02:29,5 --> 00:02:36,4
to another. And back then when I was cutting my teeth in IT, it was from a laptop back to the office. 

24
00:02:36,5 --> 00:02:42,4
Now these days, right, fast forward like, I don't know, 20 years or whatever and VPNs are a boatload more 

25
00:02:42,5 --> 00:02:48,4
than just that. In fact, what we're going to be talking about in this module, while it's kind of like 

26
00:02:48,5 --> 00:02:54,4
what I just talked about, it's different too. So we're going to be talking about hooking up 

27
00:02:54,5 --> 00:03:01,4
two locations via the internet, so maybe a corporate office or an existing corporate data center, 

28
00:03:01,5 --> 00:03:09,4
and hooking it up back to AWS via the internet using a VPN. And we're going to be configuring, right, 

29
00:03:09,5 --> 00:03:15,4
what is an always up VPN, not like me on the on-call laptop, right, where I only fired it up like, I don't know 

30
00:03:15,5 --> 00:03:19,4
what it was, maybe once a week or so when something information office broke. 

31
00:03:19,5 --> 00:03:27,4
No, what we're going to be doing here is a totally different beast, an always up, reliable VPN connection. 

32
00:03:27,5 --> 00:03:32,4
Anyway, okay, hopefully that does us like 1000 foot view primer on VPNs. 

33
00:03:32,5 --> 00:03:36,4
Now how we're going to go about this is pretty much like this. 

34
00:03:36,5 --> 00:03:41,4
We'll do a little bit more high level stuff, okay. Then we'll outline the major components that make up 

35
00:03:41,5 --> 00:03:50,4
an AWS VPN. After that, we'll lash one up. Then we'll talk about something called direct connect, 

36
00:03:50,5 --> 00:03:58,4
it's like a VPN, but it's also not like one. More of a full blown leased line DWDM type uber connection 

37
00:03:58,5 --> 00:04:04,4
into AWS. I know, it probably makes no sense explained like that, but no sweat, right, on my honor 

38
00:04:04,5 --> 00:04:08,4
I'll give it the full treatment later in the module. That's good for now though. 

39
00:04:08,5 --> 00:04:12,5
Let's crack on.
