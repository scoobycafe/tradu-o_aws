Next question. Yeah, thanks Nigel. Prof here from the Reckoner's, when it comes to VPCs, should I put 

2
00:00:08,828 --> 00:00:15,728
all of my different environments in a single VPC? So like, dev, test, UAT, and production, 

3
00:00:15,828 --> 00:00:26,728
all in the same VPC? Okay, pretty simple. No. Nein. Non. Mio, kaveva, het. 

4
00:00:26,828 --> 00:00:34,728
It really is as simple as that. No. Separate environments like that totally belong in their own VPCs. 

5
00:00:34,828 --> 00:00:38,828
Life will just be so much easier that way.
