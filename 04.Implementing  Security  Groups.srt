1
00:00:00,599 --> 00:00:07,066
Right then, from within our VPC console, Security Groups is down here under Security. 

2
00:00:07,166 --> 00:00:14,066
You can get to it from the EC2 dashboard as well, but if we hit it here we see our existing security groups, 

3
00:00:14,166 --> 00:00:21,066
ah, none of which are named. Slap across the face for me for laziness. 

4
00:00:21,166 --> 00:00:27,066
But here we go, okay, right. Name tag here is the friendly name that it's going to get. 

5
00:00:27,166 --> 00:00:40,066
We'll go with podcast Docker Hosts and we don't like ugly red text, so we've got to give it a description (Typing). 

6
00:00:40,166 --> 00:00:46,066
That'll do. Obviously we're going to want our podcast VPC and there it goes, creating it for us. 

7
00:00:46,166 --> 00:00:55,066
Or actually, it's creating an empty shell for us. So if we see down here, yeah, currently no inbound rules, 

8
00:00:55,166 --> 00:01:02,066
so nothing has been allowed in yet, but everything is being allowed out. 

9
00:01:02,166 --> 00:01:10,066
So back here we're going to add a rule to allow TCP port 2375. Right, good. 

10
00:01:10,166 --> 00:01:15,066
I might have forgot that. I'm going to put in a CIDR block here, but as we can see, we can totally pick 

11
00:01:15,166 --> 00:01:24,066
another security group if we want. Pretty much that would be saying allow TCP 2375 access from any host 

12
00:01:24,166 --> 00:01:27,066
that happens to be a member of whichever of these security groups we choose. 

13
00:01:27,166 --> 00:01:40,066
Nifty and all, but we'll go with 10.0.2.0/24. Restricting access, yeah, to instances in our private subnet. 

14
00:01:40,166 --> 00:01:53,066
And let's do another one. Call this one podcast web traffic, copy and paste that down here, choose our VPC, 

15
00:01:53,166 --> 00:02:08,066
and off we go again (Loading). This time, okay, we'll add HTTP and HTTPS and we'll do both of them 

16
00:02:08,166 --> 00:02:20,066
from anywhere (Typing). Okay, so there we go, right. Two new security groups, each with some inbound rules 

17
00:02:20,166 --> 00:02:27,066
and both, right, allowing all outbound traffic. Not the most secure in the world, this outbound bit here, 

18
00:02:27,166 --> 00:02:36,066
I know, but you know what? It's not uncommon either. Now if we jump over to our EC2 console, 

19
00:02:36,166 --> 00:02:42,066
and what have we got here? Hmm, not a lot really, especially in our podcast VPC. 

20
00:02:42,166 --> 00:02:55,066
So let's go fire another one up. This'll do, yep, podcast VPC, public subnet, yeah it's going to get a public IP, 

21
00:02:55,166 --> 00:03:07,066
storage is good, podcast-test is good. Ah, now if we click up here, right, see how we can select from existing 

22
00:03:07,166 --> 00:03:13,066
security groups? Lovely and all, but this time we're going to let the wizard create one for us. 

23
00:03:13,166 --> 00:03:19,066
Now by default, okay, with this being a Linux instance, it's only going to allow SSH traffic in. 

24
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:25,066
So that's just the bare minimum, right, so that we can get in and manage our instance. 

25
00:03:25,166 --> 00:03:31,066
And note the name and the description here, if we're not careful, right, we can end up with an absolute 

26
00:03:31,166 --> 00:03:41,066
rats nest of security groups that are named like this. Anyway we'll go kick it off (Typing), uh huh. 

27
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:48,066
Now while it's firing up, okay, why don't we go and give it an elastic IP from over here. 

28
00:03:48,166 --> 00:03:56,066
Okay, just got the one for right now. Let's associate it. We'll pick our instance from here, hmm, 

29
00:03:56,166 --> 00:04:01,066
I wonder, maybe it's just spinning up, yeah, we'll give it a chance to spin up, right. 

30
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:06,066
These virtual machines, you know, they're not like containers, spin up times can feel like eons if you're 

31
00:04:06,166 --> 00:04:13,066
getting used to containers. Okay, there it is now and that'll do. 

32
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:25,066
If we go back here, there we go, elastic IP. Now then, right now it's just got the one security group, yeah. 

33
00:04:25,166 --> 00:04:36,066
The one we created when launching the instance to allow SSH. So let's grab its public IP here, 

34
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:49,066
let's go fire up a session. Okay, we'll give it our private key, and yep we'll make the font a decent size. 

35
00:04:49,166 --> 00:04:58,066
Okay, let's go. Drag it over here and we're in. So let's just take a step back for a second and take stock 

36
00:04:58,166 --> 00:05:07,066
real quick. We've just SSH'ed in using the instance's public IP or its elastic IP and we're only being allowed in 

37
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:15,066
because the security group associated with the instance is allowing SSH traffic from anywhere. 

38
00:05:15,166 --> 00:05:26,066
Magic. Well, let's switch to route and we'll update our repos (Typing). 

39
00:05:26,166 --> 00:05:38,066
Okay, let me speed up time while that happens. Okay. Now we'll install the Apache web server (Typing). 

40
00:05:38,166 --> 00:05:46,066
Great, is that running? Nope. So let's go start it. Good. Right. 

41
00:05:46,166 --> 00:05:52,066
So the instance is now running the Apache web server. But obviously if we go try to connect to it 

42
00:05:52,166 --> 00:06:07,066
over here, give it a second or so, dah-dah-dah, no joy. Reason, its security group is dropping any packets 

43
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:14,066
that are not SSH. So to fix that, we'll we need to either edit the security group so that it's got a 

44
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:22,066
rule in that allows web traffic or we can add another security group that's already got a rule allowing web traffic. 

45
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:29,066
Well, we'll do the latter yeah, since we already created one of those groups just a second ago. 

46
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:37,066
So if we right click it, Networking and Change Security Groups here, we want to add this podcast web traffic 

47
00:06:37,166 --> 00:06:44,066
one here, and notice as well, we could disassociate the launch wizard one while we're here if we wanted to, 

48
00:06:44,166 --> 00:06:52,066
but we don't. And look down here, see how we've got both security groups listed now? 

49
00:06:52,166 --> 00:06:57,066
And if we view the rules, yeah, it shows us a pretty nice combo of the two. 

50
00:06:57,166 --> 00:07:04,066
So if we jump back here, try this again, bingo. Web traffic now allowed. 

51
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:12,066
Totally dynamic, yeah, totally on the fly, and totally cool. So that's security groups, yeah. 

52
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:19,066
Just one more quick thing, if you look under security groups here, yeah, we're actually not that bad, 

53
00:07:19,166 --> 00:07:25,066
I have seen this a royal mess in the past because it's so easy to spin up loads of instances without thinking of it 

54
00:07:25,166 --> 00:07:29,066
and each time let the wizard create a new security group for you. 

55
00:07:29,166 --> 00:07:35,066
You know what? Before you know it this screen is like littered with these launch wizard security groups, 

56
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:40,066
I don't know like 20 or 30 of them, yeah. So name your security groups and keep on top of them 

57
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:49,066
because they can be a proper pain to unpick. Oh yeah, I did say I'd show you how network interfaces 

58
00:07:49,166 --> 00:07:58,066
and security groups go together. Well let's jump over here, oh, where are they hiding? 

59
00:07:58,166 --> 00:08:03,066
There they are, whew, just a handful right now, one for each instance, yeah. 

60
00:08:03,166 --> 00:08:09,066
Though we can create more if we want to and then associate them with our instances, but we'll pick this one here. 

61
00:08:09,166 --> 00:08:14,066
And see how we've got that Change Security Groups option, there we go. 

62
00:08:14,166 --> 00:08:20,066
This is how we associate and disassociate security groups with network interfaces. 

63
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:26,066
And that folks is security groups, totally cool and totally important. 

64
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:29,166
But let's switch gears slightly now, let's go and look at a close cousin of the security group, network ACLs.
