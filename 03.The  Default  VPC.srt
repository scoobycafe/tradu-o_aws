00:00:00,599 --> 00:00:02,987
Now if we scroll over to the right here, 

2
00:00:03,087 --> 00:00:09,987
I want to point this out first, the VPC that we just created is not a default VPC and there's actually no way 

3
00:00:10,087 --> 00:00:15,987
that we can make it a default VPC. Well, at least there's not at the time of recording, right. 

4
00:00:16,087 --> 00:00:22,987
Now what this basically means is if we want to launch instances into our new VPC, we've got to manually select it 

5
00:00:23,087 --> 00:00:29,987
when launching the instance. In fact, let me just show you (Loading). 

6
00:00:30,087 --> 00:00:37,987
Ubuntu, okay, right. See here, a new instance is automatically going to get launched into the region's 

7
00:00:38,087 --> 00:00:42,987
default VPC, they call it network over here, yeah, but really they're named VPC. 

8
00:00:43,087 --> 00:00:49,987
Well, I guess VPC basically is a network. But the point is, if we want to launch the instance into our VPC, 

9
00:00:50,087 --> 00:00:54,987
then we need to manually go in here and pick it from the drop down. 

10
00:00:55,087 --> 00:01:00,987
We don't want to bother doing that right now though. Back to VPCs, what else about default? 

11
00:01:01,087 --> 00:01:07,987
Yeah, I think we already said, every region's got one default VPC and that gets automatically created 

12
00:01:08,087 --> 00:01:13,987
for us by AWS and there's no way to change that. So even if we delete it, which we absolutely can, 

13
00:01:14,087 --> 00:01:20,987
well then our region just ends up with no default VPC. Then later on if we suddenly decide, uh that was a mistake 

14
00:01:21,087 --> 00:01:27,987
and we really do want one, well we need to go with our begging bowl and go and beg to Amazon to recreate it for us. 

15
00:01:28,087 --> 00:01:32,987
And you know what? It's been like this since like forever, since VPCs came along in fact. 

16
00:01:33,087 --> 00:01:37,987
And I'm pretty staggered to be honest that it's not changed yet. I mean, maybe by the time you're watching it 

17
00:01:38,087 --> 00:01:45,987
it has, but right now, like summer 2015, that's the crack. We can't set a VPC to be a default, so I'd probably 

18
00:01:46,087 --> 00:01:53,987
say, right, just leave the default VPC in each region alone. We're certainly not going to use them in this course. 

19
00:01:54,087 --> 00:01:57,087
Okay, but if we look down here, right, it's easy to read a summary of our new VPC.
